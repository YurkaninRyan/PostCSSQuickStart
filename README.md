# PostCSSQuickStart

PostCSSQuickStart is a small boilerplate project that I intend on using for small personal projects as well as at Hackathons.


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/YurkaninRyan/PostCSSQuickStart.git
npm install
```

## What this does

Now that you have the base project set up as long as you build your web application in the public_html folder everything will be taken care of for you.

Running gulp will process all of your modular css files, and at the same time save the modular processed output right next to your unprocessed css for quick comparison! All processed css files will be concatenated andd stored in dist/css.

Running gulp deploy will process all of the modular css files, and concatenate them into one minified, stripped of comments file for you to include into your webpage.
